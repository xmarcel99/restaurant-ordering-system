Note the following considerations before you start taking the test:
● We expect you to create a private repository on github or bitbucket. Then create a pull
request with your solutions, add jobs-tests@x-formation.com as a reviewer and send
us a link to it. Proper submission is also part of the test - we will reject it if it is done
in any other way.
● The usage of Maven in Java projects will be considered a plus.
TASK DESCRIPTIONS
1. Food ordering system
Imagine you have to design an application for a restaurant ordering system. Please follow the
requirements listed below:
Functional requirements:
● It’s possible to order lunch and/or drink.
● Lunch consists of a main course and dessert.
● Each meal and drink must have a name and price.
● There are three cuisines available to choose from (Polish, Mexican, Italian).
● When ordering a drink, the customer can additionally ask for ice cubes or/and lemon.
Non-functional requirements:
● It has to work “out of the box” without any additional requirements. We should be able to
run it and place an order.
● Command-line interface (no UI is required).
● The solution you come up with should be extendable (it should be possible to add new
cuisines/dishes in the future).
● It should contain unit tests.
Present your proposal of Java implementation for this application.
